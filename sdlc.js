// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisRequirements = "This is the second step, defined necessary timeline to finish the work and get detailed and precise requirements for the system."
const design = "This is the third step, in which the system and software design documents are prepared as per the requirement specification document, that helps define overall system architecture."
const implementation = "This is the forth step, where tasks are divided into units or modules and assigned to the various developers, and they start build this units."
const testingIntegration = "This is the fifth step, in which a testing team starts testing the functionality of the entire system and verify that the entire application works according to the customer requirement."
const maintain = "This is the sixth step, follows after the system is deployed, that provides the bug fixing, upgrade the application or adding some new fixtures."
